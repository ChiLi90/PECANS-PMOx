\subsection*{(Python Editable Chemical Atmospheric Numeric Solver)}

The goal of the P\+E\+C\+A\+NS multi-\/box model is to provide a relatively straightforward but efficient and flexible idealized atmospheric chemistry modeling framework. It is not intended to supplant global or regional chemical transport models such as G\+E\+O\+S-\/\+Chem, W\+R\+F-\/\+Chem, or C\+M\+AQ, but instead to offer the capability to carry out one box to 3D multi-\/box modeling with idealized (rather than real world) transport.
